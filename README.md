The work has been carried out as a part of the course 'Aeroacoustics' of masters. The motivation behind the work is to help in early detection of dangerous forms of ice over the airfoils, which can be potentially done using aeroacoustics. In this study, two kinds of ice accretions are considered, namely: Rime and Glaze. The airfoil under consideration is NACA0012 pitching with ranges of angle of attacks from -4 to 4 degrees. Then 12 observers are placed covering 360 degrees around the airfoil. The pressure fluctuations and statistical quantities for three different configurations (Clean, Rime, Glaze) were studied at different observer locations.
